WARNINGL The other files in this folder contain code that uses GEANT4! You'll have to get the GEANT4 library in order to be able to compile it.
The code in this folder creates a simulation of Cherenkov radiation, as well as several detectors that track the energy of said radiation.
It was a small project meant to test my mastery of GEANT4, as well as my proficiency in C++.
